And while the startup and new technologies sector represents a major reservoir of jobs creation in Africa, it requires the development and acquisition of specific skills, which are still too little taught and represented.

      "On average, women in Africa own fewer assets than men. They often lack the collateral necessary to secure larger loans and may be required to present significantly more collateral for the same size loan as their male counterpart. This further decreases womenâ€™s access to capital. Additionally, women tend to perceive their credit-worthiness lower than it actually is. Thus, women resort to informal and unregulated networks for financing rather than relying on institutional investors. As a result, they are subjected to higher interest rates, exposed to financial scams, spiral into more debt, and are vulnerable to abuse in cases of failure to repay.  ",
      "The challenges are further compounded for a significant subset of women in the South African township economy ecosystem. These are immigrant female entrepreneurs - who often have limited or no access to formal opportunities.  ",
