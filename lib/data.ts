Despite the huge potential of the human capital, there is a need for key competencies and skills in many sectors amongst which the digital economy. The Boston Consulting Group identified that in order to meet the demand for digital services on the continent, 650 million workers would need to be trained or upskilled in digital skills by 2030. And while the startup and new technologies sector represents a major reservoir of jobs creation in Africa, it requires the development and acquisition of specific skills, which are still too little taught and represented. In this context, training in digital and tech skills and support for startups is a priority for Digital Africa. This commitment is reflected in the Talent 4 Startups program. ",

      "On average, women in Africa own fewer assets than men. They often lack the collateral necessary to secure larger loans and may be required to present significantly more collateral for the same size loan as their male counterpart. This further decreases women’s access to capital. Additionally, women tend to perceive their credit-worthiness lower than it actually is. Thus, women resort to informal and unregulated networks for financing rather than relying on institutional investors. As a result, they are subjected to higher interest rates, exposed to financial scams, spiral into more debt, and are vulnerable to abuse in cases of failure to repay.  ",
      "The challenges are further compounded for a significant subset of women in the South African township economy ecosystem. These are immigrant female entrepreneurs - who often have limited or no access to formal opportunities.  ",
      "The purpose of this research is to collate perspectives from three groups of stakeholders on gender-lens investing and present recommended terms and conditions for financing that incorporates female-friendly principles and address power dynamics between investors and beneficiaries, particularly for local and immigrant female entrepreneurs in the semi-formal and informal economies.
