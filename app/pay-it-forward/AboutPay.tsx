          <p className="mb-4 font-light">This initiative is an arm of the DoDigi project. </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-medium">The initiative is targeted at girls in high school, between the ages of 13 and 19 years. The purpose is to inform, empower and positively influence them in making decisions that will direct their future in the right path to yield successful life outcomes beyond high school.</p>
         <h3 className="mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-gray-900 ">The societal problem addressed	</h3>
         <p className="mb-4 font-medium">Girls and young women&apos;s access, retention and completion in schools is still of huge concern in Africa. The latest figures from UNESCO (2019) show that 52 million girls are not in school in Africa, while 4 million will never step into a classroom compared to 2 million boys. Girls remain more likely to be permanently excluded from education and at a higher risk of being left behind. </p>
         <p className="mb-4 font-medium">Only by partnerships and individuals taking up responsibility can we make significant progress for girls in Africa. </p>
